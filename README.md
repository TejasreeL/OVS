# Online Voting System

This project can be used as a starting point to create your own Vaadin application with Spring Boot.
It contains all the necessary configuration and some placeholder files to get you started.

## Overview

This project provides an online portal for colleges to facilitate voting by classifying students with respect to the communities they are a part of. By doing this, the polls can be organized in a way where the opportunity to vote is only for those who must vote and will not be open to everyone in such cases.
